        <h2 class="post-title">(pt 1.?) small scale electronics: setting up an OLED display with an ESP32: </h2>
        <p class="post-text">electrical stuff is definetly not my strength, i wont lie. i mean i love learning about the electrical components, and i honestly wouldve seriously considered persuing an electrical engineering major if it werent for the D i got in physics class my freshmen year of highschool. regardless of my lack of skill, i set off on a journey to set up an OLED display screen with an ESP32. the most frustrating part was actually getting the mini computer in the damn breadboard, considering i bought it through alliexpress(my fault, now i know better). i programmed the actual display part of it through arduino, which was pretty beginner friendly, especially considering it was set up for coding through C++, which ive never programmed in. (ChatGPT was definetly an aid for this!!). apparently arduino is actually compatable with other languages, but at the time i was getting impatient and was really craving some physical results. </p>

      <p class="post-text">i know this was a pretty simple project, but i have virtually 0 experience with microcomputers so this was met with quite a few obstacles. i plan to have this display animations instead of some basic text, but im not totally sure if im ever going to make this serve a practical use. when i decide to go back to this, im going to take the time to figure out the stretch of its language compatabilities, as i really dont feel like picking up yet another upper level programming language. </p>
