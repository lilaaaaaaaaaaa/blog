    <p>wsg guys! i created this blog from scratch just to sharpen up my html abilities as well as having a spot to put my little technological projects and research. nothing here is going to be crazy advanced, im just here for fun. i don't tend to stick in one specific field for too long so be prepared for a lot of varied projects and posts. (and probably a shit ton of abandoned projects) im heading to college next year, probably for IT or cybersecurity (or some program related to the field), as of now Im enrolled in online school, and have time to fufill projects like these. i hope to be able to keep it up in college, because learning programming and command line and network security, etc. has been an absolute blast. besides tech stuff im a huge fan of playing guitar and cooking, thats about all there is to know about me. good god. i need to get better at writing 'about me' pages.</p>
