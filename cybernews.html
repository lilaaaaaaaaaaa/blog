    <p class="post-text">i hope you guys liked the title on this one. chatgpt came up with it for me. (atleast im honest.)</p>
    <p class="post-text"> I know this one isnt quite it the realm of cyberattacks or vulnerabilities, but I thought with the cyber-investigation underweigh, it was theme-fitting enough. I'm sure some of you guys have seen advertisments or personally downloaded the browser extension 'Honey'. i remember seeing a billion adds for this site back in the late 2010's. It's a popular yet free browser extension that finds coupons for you when doing online shopping. </p>
    <h3>So, What actually happened? </h3>
    <p class="post-text"> The popular browser extension Honey—known for helping users find discounts—has come under fire for some shady practices that have left consumers and influencers deceived. Here's the deal: normally, Honey takes credit for transactions when users apply its coupon codes. sounds harmless, right? But it doesn't stop there.

    it turns out that even when users don’t actively use Honey, the extension would still sneakily replace the transaction cookie with its own. This allowed Honey to claim the full commission from the sale—without the user ever needing to use a coupon. In essence, Honey was fraudulently claiming credit for sales, stealing money from retailers and influencers who were supposed to get their rightful share.

    What's even more concerning is that influencers who were promoting Honey were also being cheated out of their earnings because Honey was taking the commission for themselves. So not only were retailers losing money, but influencers who thought they were benefiting from promoting the extension were also left in the lurch.
