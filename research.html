        <h2 class="post-title">thinking in systems by Donella H. Meadows</h2>
        <p class="post-text">this one actually popped up on my spotify as a recommended audiobook. although the title made it sound a little vague and bland, the book is absolutely fascinating. please note that this book is not specifically  geared towards technology or computers, but information systems and computers are often cited for many examples and analogies. but because computers are made up of a bazillion different systems, its totally relevent. so im going to put it here. and you're gonna like it. </p>
       <p class="post-text"> look: i know i said this about the last book i talked about, but the book is able to philosophize systematic thinking and i think if it hadn't aproached sytematic based thinking in that sort of manner, it wouldve failed to retain any readers. </p>
    <p class="post-text"> im sorry i made you sit through two full paragraphs before getting to the actual contents of the book. the book informs readers about the process of thinking in systems, and advertizes it as a way of life, not just a problem solving tool. it encourages readers to keep in mind the infinitly complex interactions between things. think the stock market. think ecosystems. think of a computers performance. the success and failures of these different systems - although normally explained in  a simplistic manner, have an insane amount of small parts working together determining its outcome. we can look at a few things to identify as factors: ex: the number of wolves when discussing why the deer population is struggling to maintain itself. but in reality, we humans only tend to hit the tip of the iceberg when discussing factors that determine the outcome of a system.</p>
    <p class="post-text">our ignorance of just how little we understand about the systems in our everyday life is a contributor to the anger and dissilusion we tend to feel with systems in our everyday life. we don't understand why people vote the way they do. we dont understand why people act the way they do. we dont understand fucking anything. the confusion manifests itself as anger, and instead of improving ourselves (with the vast amount of knowledge at our fingtips!) we sit there angry. thats what its like to be human. will we change as a species? will it be our downfall as a species? who knows. </p>

        <h2 class="post-title">looking at computers through a new lens: "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"</h2>
        <p class="post-text">This was a fire book recommended to me when I was discussing how computer science classes were taught. Instead of the authors sitting you down and making you weed through JavaScript code or immediately teaching you about functions, it begins by discussing the very beginning of computers.</p>
        <h3 class="post-quote">"When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don’t think we are. I think we’re responsible for stretching them, sending them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun."</h3>
   <p class="post-text">i mean seriously, were given an infinitely complex machine that can calculate and reason and has changed our entire way of life. yet the majority of computer science classes still bore their students half to death. i really appreaicate the philosophical and abstract approach to computers that the book gives. the authors dont pretend to understand everything about computers, which makes it feel a lot less lecture-y. im still struggling to grasp the book myself due to its density and length (over 800 fucking pages!!), the book gives readers an entirely new perspective to view the wonders of computers and IT.</p>
