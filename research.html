        <h2 class="post-title">looking at computers through a new lens: "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"</h2>
        <p class="post-text">This was a fire book recommended to me when I was discussing how computer science classes were taught. Instead of the authors sitting you down and making you weed through JavaScript code or immediately teaching you about functions, it begins by discussing the very beginning of computers.</p>
        <h3 class="post-quote">"When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don’t think we are. I think we’re responsible for stretching them, sending them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun."</h3>
   <p class="post-text">i mean seriously, were given an infinitely complex machine that can calculate and reason and has changed our entire way of life. yet the majority of computer science classes still bore their students half to death. i really appreaicate the philosophical and abstract approach to computers that the book gives. the authors dont pretend to understand everything about computers, which makes it feel a lot less lecture-y. im still struggling to grasp the book myself due to its density and length (over 800 fucking pages!!), the book gives readers an entirely new perspective to view the wonders of computers and IT.</p>
